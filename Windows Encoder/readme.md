"It's written in VBA .NET5.0 64-Bit but should run standalone. No need to install (despite the setup.exe file) just unzip into a folder (can be on a USB stick) and run the Oceanic TX Simulator.exe file. It's a clean app, nothing saved to registry etc.

If you select the save to disk function it will create a wav file in the same folder as the main exe file. If you select continuous play it will transmit every 5 or so seconds depending upon the model of TX you choose. You can run two copies together with different settings to simulate multiple transmitters."
